  "Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC)": [
    "On gross examination, clear cell renal cell carcinoma typically appears as a yellow mass, often with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.",
    "Microscopic analysis reveals tumor cells with abundant clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm and distinct cell membranes.",
    "The tumor commonly grows in alveolar, nested, or solid patterns.",
    "A characteristic microscopic feature is the presence of a rich, delicate branching capillary network within the stroma.",
    "Nuclear morphology is variable and is assessed for ISUP grading from I to IV.",
    "Inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene is the most frequent genetic alteration in sporadic cases.",
    "Loss of VHL function leads to the stabilization and accumulation of HIF transcription factors.",
    "Increased HIF promotes the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and growth, such as VEGF and PDGF.",
    "Immunohistochemistry typically shows positivity for PAX8, CD10, RCC marker, and Vimentin.",
    "Diffuse, strong membranous staining for Carbonic Anhydrase IX is highly characteristic, particularly in VHL-associated tumors.",
    "Clinical presentation is often asymptomatic, with tumors discovered incidentally on imaging.",
    "Symptomatic patients may present with the classic triad of hematuria, flank pain, and a palpable abdominal mass.",
    "Paraneoplastic syndromes can also occur in patients with ccRCC."
