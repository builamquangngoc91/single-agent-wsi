  "No Tumor (Negative Lymph Nodes)": [
    "Grossly, negative lymph nodes may be normal in size or enlarged due to benign reactive changes.",
    "Microscopically, the overall nodal architecture is preserved with an intact capsule and open sinuses.",
    "The cortex typically exhibits reactive follicular hyperplasia with variably sized follicles and prominent germinal centers.",
    "Germinal centers are well-demarcated, polarized, and contain numerous tingible body macrophages, indicating a benign proliferative process.",
    "The background lymphoid population is polymorphous, comprising a mixed population of small lymphocytes, centrocytes, centroblasts, and immunoblasts.",
    "Medullary and subcapsular sinuses are often expanded by benign histiocytes, a finding known as sinus histiocytosis.",
    "No foreign cell populations, such as cohesive nests of carcinoma or single atypical cells, are identified within the node.",
    "Immunohistochemistry for Pan-Cytokeratin is negative, confirming the absence of metastatic epithelial cells.",
    "BCL2 protein expression is negative within germinal centers, a key feature distinguishing a reactive process from follicular lymphoma.",
    "This finding corresponds to a pN0 stage in the AJCC cancer staging system, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis.",
    "The absence of lymph node metastasis is a powerful positive prognostic indicator for most solid tumors.",
    "A pN0 status directly influences clinical decisions regarding the necessity and scope of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy."
